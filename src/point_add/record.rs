//! immediately when it is not, and a file or a report written at the end of the
//! build. Two are diagnostics, one per factor of the score; the third is a
//! required input to the GPU screen.
//!
//! **Nothing here can move the op stream.** These only read it, so `ops.bin` is

//! safe to run against a circuit whose tail nonce is already ground.

//! | knob | reports |

//! | `PEAK_CENSUS_PHASE` | restrict that search to phases containing this substring |
//! | `TRACE_CCX_SITES=1` | `ccx_sites.tsv`: which construction *emitted* each Toffoli |
//! | `CCX_BACKTRACE=<idx>,...` | a full backtrace at those op indices |
